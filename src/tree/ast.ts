//      to traverse, we have a separate array of integers called stack. it will store the ancestry stack as the index of the ancestor nodes.
//      so to get a node's parent is easy.
//      we can know where we are at any point because we know our parent's index, and we know our index, and we know how many children our parent has, so we can also figure out how many children our parent has left to go pretty easily
